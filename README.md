# Hi, I'm Selim ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Manchester (graduating 2026), passionate about systems programming, backend engineering, and applying technology in finance.  
Iâ€™ve co-founded a startup (Avalanche Tech), built production-ready platforms, and completed internships in brokerage and research where I was mentored by senior leaders and exposed to how ML/AI are used in financial analysis.  
Currently, Iâ€™m applying for graduate Software Engineering roles at leading tech and trading firms.
